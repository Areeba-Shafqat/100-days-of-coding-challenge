// Question 14: Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var guests = ["Iqra", "Aqsa", "Fatima", "Eisha"];
for (var i = 0; i < guests.length; i++) {
    console.log("Hello! dear ".concat(guests[i], ", would you like to join me for dinner?"));
}
