<h1>ðŸš€ Day 21 Challenge! ðŸš€</h1>
<p><h3><strong>Q61.Making Enums for Vehicles:</strong></h3>Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.</p>
<p><h3><strong>Q62.Making a Student Template:</strong></h3>Create a blueprint for student information, including their name, age, and the classes they're taking, and then fill in this blueprint with an example student.</p>
<p><h3><strong>Q63.Shape Shifter:</strong></h3>Write a program that can describe either a circle or a rectangle using a special type alias, including properties unique to each shape.</p>
<h1>ðŸš€ Day 22 Challenge! ðŸš€</h1>
<p><h3><strong>Q64.Combine Strings and Numbers:</strong></h3>Write a function that merges a piece of text with a number. For example, if provided with "Age: " and 30, it should give back "Age: 30".</p>
<p><h3><strong>Q65.Determine the Remainder:</strong></h3>Make a function that gets two numbers and shows the leftover from dividing them using the % sign. For example, remainder(5, 2) should give 1.</p>
<p><h3><strong>Q66.Logical AND Verification:</strong></h3>Create a function that checks two boolean (true or false) values. It should only say true if both are true, using the && operator. For instance, checkBothTrue(true, false) should be false.</p>
<h1>ðŸš€ Day 23 Challenge! ðŸš€</h1>
<p><h3><strong>Q67.Arithmetic with Mixed Types:</strong></h3>Write a function that takes two parameters: a number and a string that represents a number (e.g., "5"). Return their sum as a number.</p>
<p><h3><strong>Q68.Multiplying Decimals:</strong></h3>Create a function that accepts two decimal numbers and returns their product. Round the result to two decimal places.</p>
<p><h3><strong>Q69.Dividing and Finding the Remainder: </strong></h3>Write a function that divides two numbers and returns both the quotient and the remainder. Use an object to return both values.</p>
<h1>ðŸš€ Day 24 Challenge! ðŸš€</h1>
<p><h3><strong>Q70.Understanding let in Loops:</strong></h3>Write a function that uses a loop with the let keyword to print numbers from 1 to 5. Explain how the let keyword affects the visibility of the loop variable.</p>
<p><h3><strong>Q71.Compare let and const:</strong></h3>Create two examples where let allows reassignment but const does not. Try to reassign a const-declared variable and catch the error.</p>
<p><h3><strong>Q72.Block Scope with let and const:</strong></h3>Demonstrate block scope by creating a code block with {} that uses both let and const. Show how variables declared inside the block are not accessible outside of it.

<h1>ðŸš€ Day 25 Challenge! ðŸš€</h1>
<p><h3><strong>Q73. Assigning and Updating Variables:</strong></h3>Create a function where you declare a variable using let and assign an initial value. Then, update its value within the same function and log both the initial and updated values.</p>
<p><h3><strong>Q74.Add a Special Number:</strong></h3>Demonstrate how to swap the values of two variables. Start with variables a = 5 and b = 10, then swap their values so that a becomes 10 and b becomes 5.</p>
<p><h3><strong>Q75.Compound Assignment Operators:</strong></h3>Use compound assignment operators to simplify arithmetic operations. Start with x = 4 and perform a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on x using compound operators.</p>
